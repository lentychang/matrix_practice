# matrix_practice
Practice designing classes for multi-dimensional matrix multiplication with C++11 and newer feature


# TODO
1. Write down requirements for basic, advanced Matrix  
2. Write corresponded Test  
3. Add corresponded tests to heap and stack  
4. Implement different matrices on heap and stack  




# Test
In order to run test, please install libgtest-dev on your OS or install google test following its guideline.  
For debian-based system: `sudo apt install libgtest-dev`
